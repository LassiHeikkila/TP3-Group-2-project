Plan:
- Solve case A analytically ✓
- Solve case A numerically (first with MATLAB stuff that was written for the P309H Numerical Methods course) ✓
- Compare results 
- Write C++ program which is able to numerically calculate electric fields and electrostatic potentials given some starting conditions. ✓
- Write C++ program that converts a .png file into a usable form for the C++ program to calculate with.
- Solve case A again numerically, this time using the C++ program. ✓
- Compare results again.
- Convert starting conditions for case C into usable form for program. ✓
- Run the program, examine results. ✓
- Test program for other cases (B,D,E,F) ✓
- Test program with arbitrary starting conditions. ✓
- Create a GUI to use with the C++ program.
