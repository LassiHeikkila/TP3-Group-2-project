// COMPILE WITH "-std=c++11" flag or "stoi" and "stof" may not work

// This program was written by Lassi Heikkil√§, a theoretical physics student @ The University of Glasgow
// The program takes in two files and calculates the difference between each data point in those files.
// 
// The files need to have the following form:
// 	1st column: x coordinate
// 	2nd column: y coordinate
// 	3rd column: value at the (x,y) coordinates
//
// The columns should be separated by tabs, and as required by gnuplot,
//	after each change in x there should be an empty line.
//
// The program takes in command line arguments as follows:
// 0 - program name
// 1 - number of columns in input files (i.e. range of x), (if x goes from 0 to 399 then enter 400, etc.)
// 2 - number of rows in input files (i.e. range of y), (if y goes from 0 to 299 then enter 300, etc.)
// 3 - name of input file 1 (will be in the data/ subdirectory, the directory name does not need to be entered)
// 4 - name of input file 2 -||-, NOTE: enter full name of file with extension (.dat or whatever)
//
// So for example, if the program was compiled as difference.exe,
//	the x range 0 to 399, the y range 0 to 299 and the files located in data/ called file1.dat and file2.dat,
//	then you would execute the program by typing in "./difference.exe 400 300 file1.dat file2.dat".
// 
// The program outputs the results in the same format as the input files
// which can then be plotted in gnuplot, for example with pm3d map and splot.
// The output file is called difference.dat and can be found in the data/ subdirectory.
