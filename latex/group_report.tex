\begin{abstract}

The behaviour of the electric field under the presence and influence of solid
conducting objects is modelled and studied. Finite difference methods, namely
relaxation methods, are employed to solve the Laplace equation numerically,
to find the approximate form of the electrostatic potential, and hence the electric
field, present in various electrostatic systems.
We explicitly focus on two such systems: the case of a long perfectly conducting
cylinder centred between two infinite planes at potential $+V$ and $-V$; and the
case of a silicon detector---a system composed of two silicon wafers with segmented
doped implants at ground potential on one side and a uniform doped implant on the
other side, held at a potential $+V$. We compare the analytical solution of the first
system to its approximate numerical solution, and study the convergence of the
numerical methods employed.

%start of introduction
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Laplace's Equation}

Gauss' Law may used to express the relation between the \emph{divergence} of the
electric field, represented by \textbf{E}, and the \emph{charge density} $\rho$,
where $\epsilon_0$ is the \emph{permittivity of free space}:
%
\be
\nabla \cdot \bm{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
\ee
%
Alternatively (c.f. the Divergence Theorem), it can be expressed in its
integral form, as:
%
\be
\oint \limits_S \bm{E} \cdot d\bm{A} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}
\ee
%
where the integral is taken over a closed surface, $S$, and $Q$ is the enclosed charge.
In the absence of charge, as is the case outside a conductor, this reduces to the
statement the electric field is \emph{solenoidal}.

One can also relate the \emph{curl} of the electric field to the time
derivative of the magnetic field, denoted \textbf{B}, by the Maxwell-Faraday equation:
%
\be
\nabla \times \bm{E} = - \frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t}
\ee
%
If the magnetic field is constant, in other words unchanging with time, this equation
reduces to the statement that the electric field is \emph{irrotational}. A
consequence of irrotationality is that the electric field may then be written as
negative the gradient of some scalar potential, $\phi$ say. Mathematically:
%
\be
\bm{E} = -\nabla \phi
\ee
%
This scalar potential is called the \emph{electrostatic potential}.

One then has \emph{Laplace's equation}:
%
\be
\nabla^2 \phi = 0
\ee
%
where
$\nabla^2 \equiv \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$ 
is the \emph{Laplacian operator}\footnote{Specifically in Cartesian co-ordinates}.

This is a second-order partial differential equation that can be solved, given some
well-posed boundary conditions, to find the electrostatic potential and electric field
for some physical system. 

This equation is found in many areas of physics, from studies of fluid dynamics and heat
conduction to astronomy, and our analysis here could be generalised to other such areas
of physics.

\subsection{Finite Difference Methods}

It is often the case that differential equations, such as the Laplace equation, cannot
be solved analytically, and their solution must be numerically approximated.

To numerically approximate the solution to a differential equation it is
necessary to approximate the derivative of a function. The usual method employed to
do this is finite differencing. This approximates the derivative by using explicit
differencing to step the function from one value to the next in small 
increments of some variable. The smaller the increment used, the more accurate
the approximation, but the longer and more computationally intensive the process.

Suppose one wishes to approximate the first derivative of a function $f(t)$, say,
with respect to the variable $t$. The simplest way to do this is to discretise the
derivative and write
%
\be
\frac{df}{dt} \approx \frac{f(t+\Delta t) - f(t)}{\Delta t}
\ee
%
where $f(t+\Delta t)$ and $f(t)$ are two values of $f$, evaluated at two points
a distance $\Delta t$ apart. This is known as the \emph{forward difference approximation}.

To approximate the second derivative of a function, one writes
%
\be
\frac{d^2 f}{dt^2} \approx \frac{f'(t) - f'(t-h)}{\Delta t} \\
= \frac{\frac{f(t +\Delta t) - f(t)}{\Delta t} - \frac{f(t) - f(t -\Delta t)}{\Delta t}}{\Delta t} \\
= \frac{f(t +\Delta t) - 2f(t) + f(t-\Delta t)}{\Delta t ^2}
\ee

\subsection{System Desricption}
\subsubsection{System One}

Suppose one has a perfectly uniform electric field between two infinite planes
at potentials $V$ and $-V$, and they are a distance $2d$ apart. Suppose one then
places an infinitely long perfectly conducting cylinder, of radius $R$, into the centre
of the field, at ground potential, as in Figure~\ref{fig:sys one}. We wish to find the
resulting form of the electrostatic potential, and hence the electric field, surrounding
the cylinder.

\caption{Cross-sectional diagram of System One}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{System Two}

The second system considered was a silicon detector---a system consisting of two
silicon wafers, one segmented with doped implants at ground potential and the other,
referred to as the backplane, uniformly doped, held at a potential $+V$, as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:sys two}.

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analytical Solution to System One}

First, one realises that the three-dimensional problem can be reduced entirely to two
dimensions due to the translation symmetry of the system along the length of the
cylinder. So, we consider a cross-section of the system and introduce a polar
co-ordinate system, with origin centred on the centre of the cylinder.

Laplace's equation in polar co-ordinates is: 
%
\be
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial \theta^2}
= \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r}) + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial \theta^2}
= 0
\ee

We employ separation of variables and posit a solution of the form
$\phi = f(r)g(\theta)$ for two unknown functions $f$ and $g$. Upon substitution,
one finds that:
%
\be
\frac{r}{f(r)}\frac{d}{dr}(r \frac{df(r)}{dr}) =- \frac{1}{g(\theta)}\frac{d^2 g(\theta)}{d\theta^2}
\ee

Since this is true for arbitrary values of $r$ and $\theta$, it is constant, and
we---with some foreknowledge---set this equal to $k^2$, for some constant 
$k\in\mathbb{R}$.
This gives two second order ordinary differential equations:
%
\be
r\frac{d}{dr}(r \frac{df(r)}{dr}) = k^2 f(r) \qquad
\frac{d^2 g(\theta)}{d\theta^2}=-k^2 g(\theta)
\ee

For the case $k=0$, these equations have solutions
$f(r)=\alpha \ln(r) + \beta$ and $g(\theta) = \gamma \theta + \delta$.
For non-zero $k$, they have solutions
%
\be
f(r)=\alpha_k r^k + \beta_k r^{-k}
\qquad
g(\theta)= \gamma_k \sin(k\theta)+\delta_k \cos(k\theta)
\ee

With the physically reasonable requirement that $g(\theta)=g(\theta + 2\pi)$, we have
that $k$ is an integer. Hence, by the principle of superposition and the linearity of
differentiation, the general solution to the Laplace equation in polar co-ordinates is
a sum of these terms:
%
\be
\phi(r,\theta)
= f(r)g(\theta)
= (\alpha \ln(r) + \beta)(\gamma\theta + \delta) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(\alpha_n r^n+\beta_n r^{-n})(\gamma_n \sin(n\theta) + \delta_n \cos(n\theta))
\ee

For a particular solution to the system considered here one must impose boundary
conditions, specifically we use \emph{Dirichlet boundary conditions}.

By considering the geometry of the system, we expect a solution that is symmetric
about $\theta=0$. This implies that $\gamma = 0$ and $\gamma_n=0$, $\forall n$ as
$\sin()$ is anti-symmetric about the origin (c.f. odd). Additionally, the potential
is finite as $r \rightarrow \infty$, implying that $\alpha$ and $\alpha_n$ are both
zero. We now have:
%
\be
\phi(r,\theta)=\beta + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(\frac{\beta_n}{r^n} \cos(n\theta))
\ee
%
where the $\beta$'s have absorbed other constants. In particular, as
$r \rightarrow \infty$, we require $\phi=-\frac{V}{d}x=-\frac{V}{d}r\cos(\theta)$.
Since the infinite sum vanishes at infinity, $\beta=-\frac{V}{d}r\cos(\theta)$.

We now have that
%
\be
\phi(r,\theta)=-\frac{V}{d}r\cos(\theta) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(\frac{\beta_n}{r^n} \cos(n\theta))
              =(\frac{\beta_1}{r}-\frac{V}{d}r)\cos(\theta) + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}(\frac{\beta_n}{r^n} \cos(n\theta))
\ee

We require that the potential is zero on the surface of the cylinder,
$\phi(R,\theta)=0$, so that $\beta_1=\frac{VR^2}{d}$ and $\beta_{n \geq 2}=0$

Thus, the final form for the electrostatic potential is
%
\be
\phi(r,\theta)=
\begin{cases} \qquad 0, & \quad r \leq a \\
\frac{V}{d}(\frac{R^2}{r}-r)\cos(\theta), & \quad r > a
\end{cases}
\ee
%
a graph of which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:analytic}.

\section{Relaxation Methods}

\subsection{Jacobi's Iterative Method}

For our purposes, we wish to discretise the following equation:
% 
\be 
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} = 0
\label{eq:laplace}
\ee 

One can define a region on which to discretise this equation, $\{(x,y)|\:0<x<L,0<y<D\}$,
and define a grid of points of spacial separation $\Delta x$ in the $x$ direction,
and $\Delta y$ in the $y$ direction. We wish to find the value of $\phi$ at each point.

One can now approximate Eqn.~\ref{eq:laplace} as:
% 
\be
\frac{\phi_{j+1,k}-2\phi_{j,k}+\phi_{j-1,k}}{\Delta x^2} = - \frac{\phi_{j,k+1}-2\phi_{j,k}+\phi_{j,k-1}}{\Delta y^2}
\ee
%
where $j$ and $k$ index the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively.

If we use the same spacing $\Delta=\Delta x=\Delta y$ in both $x$ and $y$ directions this
reduces to the statement that the value of the potential at a specific point is the
average of the value of the potential at the four surrounding points: 
%
\be
\phi_{j,k}= \frac{1}{4}(\phi_{j-1,k}+\phi_{j+1,k}+\phi_{j,k-1}+\phi_{j,k+1})
\label{eq:relax}
\ee

Suppose one has some initial guess of the value of $\phi$ at all points, $\phi_{j,k,0}$,
say. One evaluates Eqn~\ref{eq:relax} at all points on the grid simultaneously and
generates a new better approximation for the potential, $\phi_{j,k,1}$. Iterating this
process $n$ times, one has
%
\be
\phi_{j,k,n+1}= \frac{1}{4}(\phi_{j-1,k,n}+\phi_{j+1,k,n}+\phi_{j,k-1,n}+\phi_{j,k+1,n})
\ee
%
This is known as \emph{Jacobi's iterative method}, the simplest version of a
\emph{relaxation method}, an algorithm where the numerical approximation converges or
\emph{relaxes} towards the analytical solution with increasing iterations. 

\subsection{The Gauss-Seidel Method}

An alternative relaxation method, known as the \emph{Gauss-Seidel method}, exists where
points at which the potential has already been updated by the algorithm as it loops
through the grid, namely $\phi_{j-1,k}$ and $\phi_{j,k-1}$ in our notation, are used in
the iteration scheme, as shown:
%
\be
\phi_{j,k,n+1}= \frac{1}{4}(\phi_{j-1,k,n+1}+\phi_{j+1,k,n}+\phi_{j,k-1,n+1}+\phi_{j,k+1,n})
\ee

It can be shown that this method actually converges faster than Jacobi's iterative
method, and it also has the added bonus of not requiring the previous value of the 
potential at each grid point to be stored, thus reducing computation time.

\subsection{Successive Over-Relaxation}

Neither the Jacobi iterative method or the Gauss-Seidel method utilise the value
of the potential at the current point in the previous iteration, in our notation
$\phi_{j,k,n}$. It can be shown that using this point, and defining a
\emph{relaxation parameter}, $1<s<2$, one can define the following iterative algorithm:
%
\be
\phi_{j,k,n+1}= (1-s)\phi_{j,k,n}+\frac{s}{4}(\phi_{j-1,k,n+1}+\phi_{j+1,k,n}+\phi_{j,k-1,n+1}+\phi_{j,k+1,n})
\ee
%
which is a more convergent numerical method. This technique is known as successive
over-relaxation.

\subsection{Checkerboard (Red-Black) Updating}

In each of the previous methods, the value of the potential is calculated from, at most,
its previous value at the current point and the current or previous values of the
potential at the four neighbouring points. Noting this, let us denote $\phi_{j,k}$ as
\emph{odd} if $j+k$ is odd, and even otherwise. Then the potential at each even point
solely depends on the potential at odd points (and its previous value). One could then,
in principle, iterate through the grid of points at which we approximate the potential,
and update all the odd points, and then re-iterate through the grid, updating all the
even points using the value of the potential at the newly updated odd points. Such an
iterative scheme exists, and is known as \emph{Checkerboard (Red-Black) Updating}, for
obvious reasons. It can be shown to be a more convergent method than those outlined
previously, and successive over-relaxation can easily be implemented within the scheme.
Figure~\ref{fig:checker} shows an illustration of the algorithm.
